# AWS DeepComposer Got Talent

This GitHub repo is a companion repository to the AWS DeepComposer Got Talent blog post. Please read through the blog post for instructions on how to use the code provided in this repository.

## Summary
To help you fast track your machine learning (ML) adoption, AWS offers educational solutions for developers to get hands-on experience. We like to think of these
programs as a fun way for developers to build their skills using ML technologies in real world scenarios. In the blog post, we walk you through how to prepare for and run an AI music competition using AWS DeepComposer that educates and enriches your teams and customers with the latest in ML and AI. We provide an end-to-end kit that contains tools, techniques, processes, and best practices to run the event. The code samples in this repository will be used to prepare for and execute the following steps as part of the competition:

1. What happens during the competition
2. Competition rules and guidelines
3. Participant prerequisites
4. An overview of AWS DeepComposer Music Studio and its algorithms
5. How participants can compose music using AWS DeepComposer
6. How to submit tracks
7. How to build the scoring tool and leaderboard
